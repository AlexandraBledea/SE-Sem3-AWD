          In the void of space, where there’s no air, temperature, or anything to touch, the idea of feeling seems confusing.
          How can you "feel" when there’s nothing there? Could the absence itself be something you sense?

          Imagine a fully digital existence, where beings are lines of code and binary data.
          How could "feeling" exist without physical senses or emotions? Could algorithms simulate what it means to feel?

          In a place where time doesn’t exist, feelings that come and go would seem impossible.
          Without a start or end, how could a feeling appear, change, or disappear?

          Can there be feeling without someone or something to feel it? Could a feeling exist independently,
          like a wandering entity, waiting to attach itself to a conscious mind?
